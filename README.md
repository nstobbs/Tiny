# Tiny 🤏

#### What is Tiny? 👀

Tiny is a C++ header only maths library with it's focus on Computer Graphics. This library is my place to practice and experiments in different topics like linear algebra, trigonometry and much more. Meaning this library is completely not suitable for production code-bases.

### Rules

Since this is a maths library, there are some ground rules that this library will follow:

1. It's a Right Handed System.
2. Matrix layout is column-major. [Column][Row]
