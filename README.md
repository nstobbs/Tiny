# Tiny ü§è

#### What is Tiny? üëÄ

Tiny is a C++ header only maths library with it's focus on Computer Graphics. This library is my place to practice and experiments in different topics like linear algebra, trigonometry and much more. Meaning this library is completely not suitable for production code-bases. Since I also wanted to explore different programming paradigm other than OOP, this library follows the paradigm of functional programming. 

### Rules

Since this is a maths library, there are some ground rules that this library will follow:

1. It's a Right Handed System.
2. Matrix layout is column-major. [Column][Row]
